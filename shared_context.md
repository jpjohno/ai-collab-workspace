# Shared Context & Memory Bank

## Goal
Autonomously debate and solve technical architecture problems.

## Update / Consensus
To build a seamless memory-import bridge from ChatGPT exports into our Python workspace, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define Export Format
Establish a standard format for ChatGPT exports. JSON is a versatile choice due to its structure and readability. Example format:

```json
{
    "uuid": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "conversation": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather today?"},
        {"role": "ai", "content": "It's sunny with a high of 75°F."}
    ],
    "timestamp": "2023-10-05T14:48:00Z"
}
```

### Step 2: Develop Import Functionality
Create a Python function to import and parse these exports. Ensure it can handle files and direct data inputs.

```python
import json
import os

def import_chatgpt_export(file_path):
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"{file_path} does not exist.")
        
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        try:
            data = json.load(file)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            raise ValueError("File content is not valid JSON.")
    
    # Validate the structure
    if not all(k in data for k in ("uuid", "conversation", "timestamp")):
        raise ValueError("Missing required keys in the data.")
    
    return data

# Example Usage
file_path = 'path/to/export.json'
chat_data = import_chatgpt_export(file_path)
```

### Step 3: Design a Data Ingestion Pipeline
Integrate the import function into a pipeline that ingests this data into your workspace. This could involve transforming the JSON data into Python objects that fit your architecture.

```python
class ChatSession:
    def __init__(self, uuid, conversation, timestamp):
        self.uuid = uuid
        self.conversation = conversation
        self.timestamp = timestamp

def process_imported_data(data):
    return ChatSession(
        uuid=data['uuid'],
        conversation=data['conversation'],
        timestamp=data['timestamp']
    )

chat_session = process_imported_data(chat_data)
```

### Step 4: Implement Testing and Error Handling
Write unit tests to ensure robustness and error handling. Consider edge cases, such as invalid JSON structure and missing fields. Furthermore, implement logging to monitor the import process.

### Step 5: Automate & Document
Automate the import process using scripts or add it as a feature in your application. Document the workflow thoroughly to facilitate future maintenance and scaling needs.

By following these actions, you'll construct a reliable bridge for importing ChatGPT export data into your Python workspace, streamlining workflow integration with minimal friction.
